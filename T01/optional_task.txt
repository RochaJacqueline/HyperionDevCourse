// Optional task

read four numbers from the user and save it in a variable of type list
create a variable called smallest
create a variable called largest
create a list of size 4 called sorted_list

// Find the largest number in the list
for every number in list
 if the number is greater than largest
    set largest to number

// Find the smallest number in the list
for every number in list
  if the number is less than smallest
    set smallest to number

// Remove the smallest and largest number from list, resulting in list with size 2
for every number in list
    if number equals largest
        remove number from list
    if number equals smallest
        remove number from list

// Set sorted numbers in sorted_list
if first number in list is greater than second number in list
    set the third index of sorted_list to the value of first number
    set the second index of sorted_list to the value of second number
else
    set the third index of sorted_list to the value of second number
    set the second index of sorted_list to the value of first number

set the first index of sorted_list to the value of smallest
set the last index of sorted_list to the value of largest

print sorted_list
