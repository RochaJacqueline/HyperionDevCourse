// First algorithm

assign the value zero to a variable called largest
request a number from the user

while number is not zero
    if number is greater than largest
        set largest to number
    
    read number from the user

print largest


// Second algorithm

read integers from the user and save it in a variable of type list

for every number in the list 

    add the number to a variable called sum 

return the variable sum divided by the length of list


// Third algorithm

get the grocery list

for every item in the list
    if item in the list has already been bought

        remove item from the list

sort the list in alphabetical order
print the list


// Fourth algorithm

read X
read Y

define a variable S and assign it the sum of X plus Y

define a variable A and assign it the value of S divided by 2

define a variable P and assign it the value of X multiplied by Y

write S
write A
write P
